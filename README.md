# Reservia | Travel Website

This is the second project of the web developer program from OpenClassrooms.

Reservia is a website offering a vacation planning tool. It allows users to find accommodations and activities in the city of their choice.

Aim of the project was to turn mockups into a webpage without using any framework. Mockups for the Reservia Travel Website were provided for desktop and mobile, as well as a logo and all images. In order to make the website fully-responsive, suitable breakpoints were determined and adaptations were made for tablet layout.
